Challenge for password cracking assignment
------------------------------------------

This challenge consists of the following files:

INSTRUCTIONS: This file.

passwd1.txt and passwd2.txt:
UNIX password files, with hashed and salted passwords. The hashes are
computed with the Jcrypt function.

passwd1-plain.txt:
Plaintext passwords for the entries in passwd1.txt.

passwd2-plain.txt:
Empty file. Your job is to fill in this file with plaintext passwords
for the entries in passwd2.txt. The passwords do not need to be in any
particular order. Just fill in all passwords that you find. The file
must only contain passwords, nothing else.  One password per line.

Makefile:
Configuration file for "make" to create your submission archive. It is
absolutely necessary that you use "make" for this, otherwise all
required files will not be included, and your submission cannnot be
graded. Just type "make"!

jcrypt.java:
Java implementation of the UNIX "crypt" command. Look at the
"jcrypt.crypt" method!
